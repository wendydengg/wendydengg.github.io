<!-- Add a final statement, titled “Looking Forward.” This should be  a brief statement outlining three concrete steps that you’ll take after this class to bring some of the work we’ve done together into your future learning. Maybe you want to follow up on learning a future skill; research how you might do that and name the steps you want to take in this statement. What classes will you take next? What books do you want to read? Who are your people, and how will you find them? -->

Concrete steps after Digital Humanities:

1. I have always been interested in text data and linguistics, and I have been thinking about doing research perhaps with Professor CCB in natural language processing (NLP), but now I want to understand how we can apply NLP to different fields like Humanities while navigating ethics issues -- this will probably be my research project for next semester
2. I've been recommended to read _The Message_ by Ta-Nehisi Coates, which explores the power of stories to shape reality and the importance of embracing difficult truths. Since this course has led me to think how subjective our "data" acually is since it is told by the lens of one person, I want to further explore what it means to experience a "reality" told through the lens of another person
3. I want to take CIS 6300 to further my understanding of NLP, specifically on how to apply NLP to existing problem domains and conduct research in NLP
