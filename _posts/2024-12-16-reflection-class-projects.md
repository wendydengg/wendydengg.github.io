<!-- Go back over the two main projects we worked on together, your contributions to the Printing in Prisons website and your collaborative project in the EC. Think about our goals with these exercises, how the readings at the beginning of the semester prepared us for them, and how you chose to fulfill them. Also review any workshop reflections you wrote and any data you uploaded as part of these projects.  -->

The overarching theme of our two main projects of Printing in Prisons website and the collaborative project in the Education Commons (EC) was introduced during our class on October 7th, during which we learned about the storage problem of digital assets as well as the effort to humanize data.

The storage problem refers to the dilemma that as digital forms of information increase, there is also an increasing demand for larger storage space online as well as physically. This presented a new type of challenge that troubled people who initially thought of digitalization as a way to mitigate the fragility of materials like paper. Moreover, the labor that goes into digitalization is often forgotten or uncredited, although the intent of the creator to preserve information in its original form is usually clear. For example, the project [Across Walls](https://www.acrosswalls.org/section/introduction/) presents images of prisoners without names and description, and the site also lacks institutional affilation and funding, but it is clear that this project is meant to humanize those prisoners but simply could not or did not find more informations about them due to funding issues. 

In an reference to the reading/video in our very first class, Giorgia Lupi emphasizes the importance to allow people to "interact with information through data visualization and through building interactive experiences with these visualizations" ([Finding Humanity in Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYRhCZ0vvFQ)). Thus, in an effort to showcase historical information through visual and interactive experiences and to avoid the storage problem, we find creative ways to search for and document our findings through these two main class projects. 

The [Printing in Prisons](https://printinginprisons.org/) was created by Professor Trettien as an effort to uncover the lives of prisoners in the Eastern State Penitentiary (ESP) through the stories told in newspapers, the Umpire, printed in the ESP. As opposed to the Across Walls project, Printing in Prisons tells stories about the prisoners directly from their own lens, and to do so, we picked a topic of our interest and read as much information as possible about it through an archive of the Umpire. I picked the topic of Women in the ESP because they were not part of the print shop in printing those newspapers and were heavily outnumbered by male inmates, but they were an important part of the ESP as evident through the mentions of female embroidery and knitting works, as well as how "female beauty" made the male inmates feel refreshed. Throughout my writing, I constantly reminded myself to simply be a person who collects and synthesizes information as unfiltered as possible in order to preserve the original meaning of the text.

Similarly, our [project in the EC](/blog/2024/fabrication-workshop/) also emphasizes the purpose of displaying information in its unfiltered, original intent. As part of the fabrication group, we had access to the printing machine and was intrigued by how words and figures can be etched into different materials. Since the articles in the Umpire emcompass a lot of topics ranging from poems to baseball to religion, we decided to focus on how religion is a strong prevalence in the Umpire and the minds of prisoners. Keeping in mind of the storage problem of digital assets, this project allowed us to create something physical that captures the essense of a part of life in the ESP.

Lastly, I also went to a [workshop at Penn](/blog/2024/web-scraping-workshop/) that taught us how to use the Python library BeautifulSoup to scrape the web as well as how to do so ethically. Through the readings and class projects, I realized that issues such as the storage problem and the inability to represent moments of life in history beyond mere words stemmed from the fact that there are a plethora amount of information on the web, but most of them are not synthesized or compacted to create meaning. Through techniques like web-scraping, we can find information on the web that are only relevant to our topic of interest. For example, we could use relevant keywords to find more information about women in prison or how religion manifested itself in writings by the inmates, given that those information are publically available or able to be scraped with the consent of the web owner.
