<!-- Write a statement (800-1000 words) synthesizing the work you've done and, more importantly, reflecting on it in relation to the topics we discussed throughout the semester. In this statement, you should cite two internal sources from the class readings/videos/visits. You should also link to any project work you produced and embed relevant photos. Overall, questions you should answer in this statement may include:
What are some of the themes and topics that emerged from our class, in our readings, discussions, and assignments? How did the external workshops augment or challenge what we were doing in class?
Similarly, do you notice any patterns or connecting threads that you may not have noticed when we were in the middle of the semester?
What did you expect digital humanities to be coming into the class? What do you think it is now?
Did you discover anything new and exciting about your own interests? Or did some part of our class affirm your own interests?
What do you think you did well in your own work? What did you wish you had done better in your own work? How would you revise or redo it, given the chance? -->

The process of working with humanities data is fundamentally different from other disciplines. In fact, As Rawson and Muñoz argue in their seminal work "Against Cleaning," researchers working in the humanities domain should be hesitant to call such knowledge "data" and must approach data with a nuanced understanding that goes beyond simple digitization or transcription. Specifically, humanities data is not about creating a clean, uniform dataset, but about preserving the rich, complex narratives embedded within historical artifacts. Simply gathering "data" for humanities research is analogous to reading a line of text without knowing the context surrounding it. Although technology like AI has advanced to the point of understanding and generating text from context, it would be difficult to do so for humanities research due to the nature that most of the historical information is stored in physical objects and the fact that these types of "data" simply cannot be generated, or else its historical context would be lost. Throughout this semester, we've engaged in several projects to experience what it's like to gather and synthesize information for humanities research and to create physical representations of history, with the themes of humanizing data and retelling history (themes were also explored in my [reflection on the two main course projects](/blog/2024/reflection-class-projects/)).

One of our first projects was to generate data and metadata on articles pertaining to the Reformatory Records using Tesseract, a tool to extract text from images. From searching through the Reformatory Records on the [Pennsylvania State Archieves Power Library](https://digitalarchives.powerlibrary.org/psa/) to extracting the information needed through Tesseract, we experienced first-hand how difficult it is to transform material information such as text on paper to digital information on the web. Not only is it that there are hundreds of pages to go through, nor the fact that those pages were stored on a website that houses couple thousands of similar collections, causing difficulties in simply rendering the pages, this process also requires us to be very meticulous in tranferring the data to digital format to ensure that text is not lost nor translated incorrectly. After transferring the text, we also noted down the metadata surrounding the current text, including page number, release date, volume, and tags, in order to capture the full context of the information we have just extracted. This is important because like Professor Trettien and Professor Lesser have said in their essay, "Material / digital," the metadata is just as important as the data itself, but "the process of linking and uploading these photos strips them of the information most relevant to understanding them as material objects in themselves, namely the Exif (exchangeable image file format) metadata" (20. Material / digital, 414), which is why it is of ulmost importance to note down the metadata manually. The [Web-Scraping Workshop](blog/2024/web-scraping-workshop/) that I have attended at the Research Data & Digital Scholarship (RDDS) Exchange at Van Pelt underscored this challenge. It introduced us to a powerful tool that can gather information on the web that is publically available or available through the consent of its owner, but with text on paper or information that is stored behind a paywall, such as with most historical content, web-scraping cannot be easily utilized. As Rawson and Muñoz suggest, the goal is not to create a perfectly "cleaned" dataset, but to build an index that preserves the diversity and contextual richness of the original materials, which is why manual curation of such data is still be best way to gather information in order to preserve its history.

I have detailed my reflection on the two main course projects on my contribution to the Printing in Prisons project and the collaborative workshop in the Education Commons in a [separate article](/blog/2024/reflection-class-projects/), but the message from those projects stayed consistent: to understand what it's like to be a researcher in digital humanities from gathering and synthesizing data that is not easily accessible on the web or even in paper, to building a story out of it. In particular, the Printing in Prisons project demanded that we look thoroughly through the articles to extract traces of life pertinent to our chosen topic in order to understand the human experiences beyond words printed onto papers. We weren't just transcribing text; we were creating a nuanced representation of historical experiences either through written format or a symbolic representation.

Coming into this class, I expected a straightforward process of digitalizing and analyzing humanities data as a student studying data science, but I did not expect the meticulous process that goes behind carefully understanding the context of the data and the lives that those data represent. In fact, I even catch myself hesitating on saying the word "data" because the information we gathered were not facts; they were stories told through lens of individuals, shaped my their experiences, and retold through our own interpretations. Now, I recognize digital humanities as a interpretive practice that requires us to be critically aware of how we represent and transform information, whether that information pertains to the humanities domain or any other domain, and I will carry that lesson in mind through my future career as I work with "data."
