<!-- Write a statement (800-1000 words) synthesizing the work you've done and, more importantly, reflecting on it in relation to the topics we discussed throughout the semester. In this statement, you should cite two internal sources from the class readings/videos/visits. You should also link to any project work you produced and embed relevant photos. Overall, questions you should answer in this statement may include:
What are some of the themes and topics that emerged from our class, in our readings, discussions, and assignments? How did the external workshops augment or challenge what we were doing in class?
Similarly, do you notice any patterns or connecting threads that you may not have noticed when we were in the middle of the semester?
What did you expect digital humanities to be coming into the class? What do you think it is now?
Did you discover anything new and exciting about your own interests? Or did some part of our class affirm your own interests?
What do you think you did well in your own work? What did you wish you had done better in your own work? How would you revise or redo it, given the chance? -->
