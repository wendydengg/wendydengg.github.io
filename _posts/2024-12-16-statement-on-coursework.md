<!-- Write a statement (800-1000 words) synthesizing the work you've done and, more importantly, reflecting on it in relation to the topics we discussed throughout the semester. In this statement, you should cite two internal sources from the class readings/videos/visits. You should also link to any project work you produced and embed relevant photos. Overall, questions you should answer in this statement may include:
What are some of the themes and topics that emerged from our class, in our readings, discussions, and assignments? How did the external workshops augment or challenge what we were doing in class?
Similarly, do you notice any patterns or connecting threads that you may not have noticed when we were in the middle of the semester?
What did you expect digital humanities to be coming into the class? What do you think it is now?
Did you discover anything new and exciting about your own interests? Or did some part of our class affirm your own interests?
What do you think you did well in your own work? What did you wish you had done better in your own work? How would you revise or redo it, given the chance? -->

Humanities data is unlike the data used in scientific disciplines; in fact, many researchers working in the humanities domain hesitant to call such knowledge "data" ([_Against Cleaning_](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.5749/j.ctvg251hk.26.pdf?acceptTC=true&coverpage=false), 279). The difference comes from the fact that data, espeically, those in teh humanities domain, has a story behind it. Simply gathering "data" for humanities research is analogous to reading a line of text without knowing the context surrounding it. Although technology like AI has advanced to the point of understanding and generating text from context, it would be difficult to do so for humanities research due to the nature that most of the historical information is stored in physical objects and the fact that these types of "data" simply cannot be generated, or else its historical context would be lost. Throughout this semester, we've engaged in

1. generate data and metadata on article related to the umpire using Tesseract, a tool to extract text from images
   experienced how difficult it is to transform material information such as text on paper to digital information on the web
   a very tedious process dealing with a large amount of data if this is a on-man job, and also requires the person to be very meticulous in order to not lose or translate text incorrectly
   like Professor Trettien has said in her essay, "Material Design," the metadata is just as important as the data itself, but "the process of linking and uploading these photos strips them of the information most relevant to understanding them as material objects in themselves, namely the Exif (exchangeable image file format) metadata"
